# Website Imitation

## Project Description

This task composed of creating a visual imitation of any website/application of our choice to practice being able to style a React page to a certain specification. As a football fan I decided to build a copy of the SkySports football page which can be accessed here:
<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football" target="_blank">Sky sports</a>
The page was styled using CSS and react-bootstrap. This is the first of my website imitation pages.
