# Website Imitation

## Project Description

This task composed of creating a visual imitation of any website/application of our choice to practice being able to style a React page to a certain specification. As a football fan I decided to build a copy of the SkySports football page which can be accessed here
[Real Page](https://www.skysports.com/football)
<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football" target="_blank">Sky sports</a>

## How to install and run this project

1) Open your terminal and navigate to the folder you want to install my project, then type

  $ git clone https://github.com/KAcodes/Hangman-Game.git

  This clones the repo

2) cd into the new folder and type

  $ npm install 

  This installs the required dependencies

3) To run the React project type 

  $ npm start

  The app will then run in development mode with path http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
